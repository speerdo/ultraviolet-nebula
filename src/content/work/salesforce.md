## Project Overview

As part of the Salesforce.org team, I contributed to the development and maintenance of the Nonprofit Cloud platform, which helps nonprofit organizations manage their operations more effectively. The Nonprofit Cloud is no longer a separate product (which was hosted at Salesforce.org), and is now a part of the main Salesforce website.

### Responsibilities
- Served as Scrum Master for the Nonprofit Cloud team
- Created custom solutions for the Nonprofit Cloud codebase
- Developed new features using Lightning Web Components
- Implemented automated accessibility testing
- Created and maintained unit tests
- Collaborated with UX team for feature implementation
