## Project Overview

EdReports is a nonprofit organization that reviews K-12 instructional materials to help educators make informed curriculum decisions. As the technical lead for their platform modernization, I migrated their legacy Java-based application with embedded Vue 3 components to a modern Nuxt.js framework, significantly improving both application performance and developer productivity.

### The Challenge

EdReports was operating on a legacy Java web application with Vue 3 components that had become difficult to maintain and scale. The existing architecture created bottlenecks in the development workflow, making new feature deployment slow and error-prone. The application served thousands of educators nationwide, so any migration needed to be seamless with zero downtime.

Key challenges included:
- Complex legacy codebase mixing Java backend with Vue frontend
- Need to maintain all existing functionality during migration
- Performance issues affecting user experience
- Developer productivity constrained by outdated tooling
- Risk management for a mission-critical educational platform

### The Solution

I architected and executed a complete migration from the legacy Java/Vue 3 stack to a modern Nuxt.js framework. This involved:

- **Strategic Planning:** Developed a phased migration approach to minimize risk and ensure continuous operation
- **Architecture Redesign:** Rebuilt the application structure using Nuxt.js best practices and modern Vue 3 composition API
- **Component Migration:** Systematically refactored and migrated existing Vue components to work within the Nuxt.js ecosystem
- **API Integration:** Maintained and improved connections to backend services while modernizing the frontend layer
- **Performance Optimization:** Implemented code splitting, lazy loading, and SSR capabilities native to Nuxt.js
- **Developer Experience:** Established new development workflows, build processes, and deployment pipelines

### Key Results

- **40% reduction in page load times** through Nuxt.js SSR and optimized asset delivery
- **30% improvement in developer productivity** with modern tooling and hot module replacement
- **Zero downtime migration** serving thousands of daily users throughout the transition
- **Improved maintainability** with cleaner codebase structure and modern development patterns
- **Enhanced performance metrics** across Core Web Vitals measurements
- **Faster feature deployment** with streamlined build and deployment processes

### Responsibilities

- Led technical architecture and migration strategy for platform modernization
- Refactored legacy Vue 3 components to work seamlessly within Nuxt.js framework
- Collaborated with EdReports team to ensure feature parity and improved functionality
- Implemented performance optimizations including SSR, code splitting, and asset optimization
- Established CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Documented migration process and created developer onboarding materials
- Provided training and support to internal team on Nuxt.js best practices
- Conducted performance testing and monitoring to validate improvements
