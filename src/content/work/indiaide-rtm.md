## Project Overview

IndiAide RTM is a HIPAA-compliant backend automation system designed for Medicare Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM). The platform streamlines healthcare provider workflows while maintaining strict regulatory compliance requirements.

### The Challenge

Healthcare providers managing Remote Therapeutic Monitoring face complex compliance requirements, manual data entry burdens, and the need to maintain accurate records for Medicare billing. Traditional systems require significant staff time for data management and lack automation capabilities.

### The Solution

I architected a comprehensive backend automation system that:

- **Automates Data Processing**: Reduces manual entry while maintaining accuracy
- **Ensures HIPAA Compliance**: Built with healthcare security requirements from the ground up
- **Streamlines Medicare Billing**: Optimizes workflow for RTM billing requirements
- **Integrates Seamlessly**: Works with existing healthcare provider systems

### Key Results

- **HIPAA-compliant automation** - Meeting all healthcare regulatory requirements
- **Medicare billing optimization** - Streamlined workflow for RTM documentation
- **Reduced manual data entry** - Freeing healthcare staff for patient care
- **Reliable data accuracy** - Automated validation and error checking

### Technical Implementation

Built on Xano with PostgreSQL for robust, scalable data management. The system uses REST APIs for integration with healthcare provider systems and implements comprehensive audit logging for HIPAA compliance. Workflow automation handles routine tasks while flagging exceptions for human review.

### Responsibilities

- Designed and architected the HIPAA-compliant backend system
- Built workflow automation for RTM data processing
- Implemented Medicare billing workflow optimization
- Created REST API integrations for healthcare systems
- Established audit logging and compliance reporting
